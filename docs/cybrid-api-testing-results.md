# Cybrid API Testing Results - Complete Analysis

**Testing Date**: September 20, 2025  
**Environment**: Sandbox  
**Integration Goal**: Cryptocurrency custodial services for merchant onboarding and crypto wallet management

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

Test complete Cybrid API integration flow for business customers:
1. OAuth authentication with proper scopes
2. Business customer creation and management  
3. Identity verification (KYB) for business compliance
4. Trading account creation for crypto assets
5. Crypto deposit address generation for wallets
6. Webhook subscription management

## ✅ Successfully Tested Features

### 1. OAuth Authentication
- **Status**: ✅ **Working**
- **Endpoint**: `https://id.sandbox.cybrid.app/oauth/token`
- **Scopes Required**: 
  - `banks:read banks:write` - Bank management
  - `customers:read customers:write customers:execute` - Customer operations
  - `accounts:read accounts:execute` - Account management
  - `deposit_addresses:read deposit_addresses:execute` - Address generation
- **Token Validity**: ~8 hours (28800 seconds)
- **Finding**: Scope validation is strict - invalid scopes cause `invalid_scope` errors

### 2. Business Customer Creation
- **Status**: ✅ **Working** 
- **API**: `POST /api/customers`
- **Sample Customer GUID**: `65297c3c7d2ebefb1fc4deff6f638491`
- **Customer Type**: `business`
- **Initial State**: `storing` → `unverified`
- **Finding**: Business customers successfully created but remain in unverified state

### 3. Individual Customer KYC Verification
- **Status**: ✅ **Working** (for comparison)
- **API**: `POST /api/identity_verifications`
- **Verification Type**: `kyc` with method `id_and_selfie`
- **Sample Verification GUID**: `9afe86e64d3e7d5c997e4c59f063ddc0`
- **State Progression**: `storing` → (will progress to verification)
- **Finding**: Individual customers support full KYC flow

### 4. USDC Trading Account Creation
- **Status**: ✅ **Working**
- **API**: `POST /api/accounts`
- **Account GUID**: `15789f4cfef3ca0aa4fa011599c90632`
- **Account Type**: `trading`
- **Asset**: `USDC`
- **Required Fields**: `type`, `customer_guid`, `asset`, `name`
- **Balance**: `platform_balance: 0, platform_available: 0`
- **Finding**: Successfully creates trading accounts for unverified business customers

## ❌ Critical Limitations Discovered

### 1. Business Customer KYB Verification
- **Status**: ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED** in sandbox (confirmed with correct scopes)
- **Error**: `"type does not have a valid value"`
- **API**: `POST /api/identity_verifications` with `"type": "kyb"`
- **Scopes Tested**: `identity_verifications:read identity_verifications:write identity_verifications:execute`
- **Impact**: Business customers cannot complete verification flow
- **Note**: Requires contact with Cybrid support to confirm sandbox vs production differences

### 2. USDT Asset Support  
- **Status**: ❌ **CONFIRMED NOT SUPPORTED** in sandbox
- **Error**: `"Invalid asset"`
- **API**: `POST /api/accounts` with `"asset": "USDT"`
- **Confirmation**: `/api/assets` endpoint shows no USDT in supported assets list
- **Available Crypto Assets**: BTC, ETH, USDC (ERC-20/Solana/Stellar), SOL, MATIC, XLM
- **Recommendation**: Focus on USDC integration first, expand to BTC/ETH later

### 3. Crypto Deposit Address Generation
- **Status**: ❌ **BLOCKED** by verification requirement
- **Error**: `"Customer has not been verified"`
- **API**: `POST /api/deposit_addresses`
- **Impact**: Cannot generate wallet addresses for business customers
- **Critical Issue**: This blocks core functionality of receiving crypto payments

### 4. Webhook Subscriptions
- **Status**: ❌ **ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITATION**
- **API**: `POST /api/subscriptions`
- **Issue**: Requests hang without response (likely requires publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint)
- **Impact**: Event handling needs proper webhook URL for testing
- **Note**: Requires retest with public HTTPS receiver (e.g., RequestBin) to confirm platform behavior

## 🏗️ Integration Architecture Implications

### Current Sandbox Limitations
1. **Business Verification Gap**: KYB not supported → customers stuck at "unverified" state
2. **Wallet Address Limitation**: Unverified customers cannot receive crypto deposits
3. **Asset Restrictions**: Only USDC confirmed working in sandbox
4. **Webhook Reliability**: Event handling may need fallback mechanisms

### Recommended Integration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
- ✅ Implement OAuth flow with proper scope management
- ✅ Create business customers (unverified state acceptable)
- ✅ Generate USDC trading accounts
- ⚠️ Handle verification status gracefully in UI

#### Phase 2: Verification Workaround  
- 🔍 Contact Cybrid support for business verification process
- 🔍 Implement manual approval workflow if needed
- 🔍 Research production vs sandbox verification differences

#### Phase 3: Wallet Functionality
- 🔄 Implement deposit address generation once verification resolved
- 🔄 Add fallback for unverified customer wallet display
- 🔄 Test address generation in production environment

#### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
- 🔄 Expand to additional crypto assets beyond USDC
- 🔄 Implement webhook handling with timeout protections
- 🔄 Add trading and balance management features

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

| Feature | Status | Error/Limitation |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| OAuth Authentication | ✅ Working | None |
| Business Customer Creation | ✅ Working | Customers remain unverified |
| Individual KYC | ✅ Working | None (for comparison) |
| Business KYB | ❌ Failed | "type does not have a valid value" |
| USDC Account Creation | ✅ Working | None |
| USDT Account Creation | ❌ Failed | "Invalid asset" |
| Deposit Address Generation | ❌ Blocked | "Customer has not been verified" |
| Webhook Subscriptions | ❌ Timeout | Request hangs |

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Contact Cybrid Support**: Clarify business verification process in sandbox vs production
2. **Alternative Verification**: Research manual approval workflows
3. **Asset Expansion**: Test additional supported crypto assets  
4. **Production Testing**: Validate findings in production environment
5. **Fallback UI**: Design user experience for unverified customer state
6. **Webhook Alternatives**: Implement polling or alternative event handling

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Cybrid authentication and basic operations work well**
2. **Business customer verification is the main blocker**  
3. **USDC integration is technically ready**
4. **Deposit address generation requires verified customers**
5. **Platform needs graceful handling of verification limitations**

**Integration Viability**: ⚠️ **Partially Ready** - Core features work but verification limitations require alternative approaches for full functionality.
