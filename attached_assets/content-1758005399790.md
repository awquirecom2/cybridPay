## Fiat options   [Skip link to Fiat options](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#fiat-options)

The Transak widget automatically defaults to the user's local currency based on their IP address and the cheapest payment method. If you want to set the fiat payment options for your users you can use the below parameters:

### Fiat Currency   [Skip link to Fiat Currency](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#fiat-currency)

#### `fiatCurrency`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#fiatcurrency)

The fiat currency you want to limit the user to buy or sell cryptocurrency with. Users will not be able to change the selection.

Format is the currency's [three letter ISO 4217 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) e.g. **GBP**.

#### `countryCode`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#countrycode)

The country whose fiat currency you want to limit the user to buy or sell cryptocurrency with. Users will not be able to change the selection.

Format is the country's [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) e.g **IN**.

**Note:** This parameter will be skipped if fiatCurrency is passed.

### Payment method   [Skip link to Payment method](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#payment-method)

All of the below parameters have the following possible values:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gbp\_bank\_transfer | pm\_open\_banking | credit\_debit\_card | apple\_pay | google\_pay |
| inr\_bank\_transfer | inr\_upi | sepa\_bank\_transfer | pm\_pse | pm\_us\_wire\_bank\_transfer |
| pm\_astropay | pm\_pix | pm\_gcash | pm\_paymaya | pm\_bpi |
| pm\_ubp | pm\_grabpay | pm\_shopeepay |  |  |

#### `defaultPaymentMethod`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#defaultpaymentmethod)

The default payment method you would prefer the customer to purchase/sell with. If you pass a defaultPaymentMethod, the payment method will be selected by default and the customer can also select another payment method.

#### `disablePaymentMethods`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#disablepaymentmethods)

A comma separated list of one or more payment methods you want to disable and hide from users, e.g. `gbp_bank_transfer`, `sepa_bank_transfer`.

## Crypto options   [Skip link to Crypto options](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#crypto-options)

The Transak widget automatically defaults to ETH on Ethereum as the crypto option. Users can choose any of the other supported cryptocurrencies to purchase.

If you want to set the default and/or limit the cryptocurrency or blockchain options for your users you can use the below parameters.

See the full list of cryptocurrencies and blockchains we support, plus their codes for passing with the below parameters, see here: [Crypto Currency Coverage](https://docs.transak.com/docs/crypto-currency-coverage).

> Double check that your `cryptocurrency` and `network` codes match ours and the combination being passed is consistent. For example `ETH` is on `ethereum` not `mainnet`.

### Crypto Currency   [Skip link to Crypto Currency](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#crypto-currency)

#### `defaultCryptoCurrency`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#defaultcryptocurrency)

The default cryptocurrency you would prefer the user to buy. Users will still be able to select another cryptocurrency, e.g. `DAI`.

#### `cryptoCurrencyCode`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#cryptocurrencycode)

The cryptocurrency you want the user to buy. Users will not be able to select another cryptocurrency, e.g. `USDT`.

The blockchain network will be the default, e.g. `ETH` will be on `ethereum`. You can pass the `network` parameter if you want the cryptocurrency on a different network, e.g. `&cryptoCurrencyCode=ETH&network=optimism`.

The user won't be able to select between multiples networks for the same cryptocurrency unless you pass the networks parameter.

#### `cryptoCurrencyList`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#cryptocurrencylist)

A comma-separated list of cryptocurrencies that you want to allow your users to buy. Only these cryptocurrencies will be shown to the user in the widget.

Format is a string of comma separated values each of which must represent a valid cryptocurrency code, e.g. `ETH,DAI,USDT`.

### Blockchain network   [Skip link to Blockchain network](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#blockchain-network)

For blockchains with multiple supported cryptocurrencies the network is specified by its name, e.g. `ethereum` or `solana`. This way you can limit users to all of the cryptocurrencies on a particular blockchain.

For blockchains where we only support the native asset the network is specified as `mainnet`. Note that for the native asset on chains where multiple cryptocurrencies are supported the network is specified by the blockchain name, not `mainnet`.

#### `defaultNetwork`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#defaultnetwork)

The default blockchain network you would prefer the user to buy cryptocurrencies on. Users will still be able to select another network, e.g. `polygon`.

#### `network`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#network)

The blockchain network you want the customer to buy cryptocurrencies on. Users will **not** be able to select another network, e.g. `ethereum`.

If you are passing `cryptoCurrencyCode` you only need to pass network if you don't want users to purchase it on the default network.

#### `networks`   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transak.com/docs/control-the-fiat-or-crypto-options-for-the-user\#networks)

A comma-separated list of blockchain networks that you want to allow your users to buy cryptocurrencies on. Only these networks' cryptocurrencies will be shown in the widget.

Format is a string of comma-separated values each of which must represent a valid network name, e.g. `ethereum,optimism,arbitrum`.
