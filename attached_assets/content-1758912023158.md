## Why use Webhooks?   [Skip link to Why use Webhooks?](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#why-use-webhooks)

When building Cybrid integrations, you might want your applications to receive events as they occur in your Cybrid organization, so that your back-end systems can execute actions accordingly.

To enable Webhook events, you need to register a Webhook endpoint(s). After you register, Cybrid can push real-time event data to your application‚Äôs Webhook endpoint when events happen in your Cybrid organization. Cybrid uses HTTPS to send Webhook events to your app as a JSON payload that includes a **Subscription** event object.

Receiving Webhook events is particularly useful for listening to asynchronous events such as when a customer‚Äôs trade is completed, a transfer is settled, or when an identity verification completes.

## Event Overview   [Skip link to Event Overview](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#event-overview)

Cybrid generates event data that we can send you to inform you of activity in your account.

When an event occurs, Cybrid generates a new **Subscription** event object. A single API request might result in the creation of multiple events. For example, if you create a new transfer for a customer, you receive `transfer.storing`, `transfer.reviewing` and `transfer.completed events`.

By registering Webhook endpoints in your Cybrid organization, you enable Cybrid to automatically send **Subscription** event\`\` objects as part of POST requests to the registered Webhook endpoint hosted by your organization. After your Webhook endpoint receives the **Subscription** event, your app can run back-end actions (for example, informing the customer a trade has been settled).

## SubscriptionEvent Object   [Skip link to SubscriptionEvent Object](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#subscriptionevent-object)

The following is an example of a SubscriptionEvent:

JSON

```rdmd-code lang- theme-light
 {
    "guid": "cf16b78e233464229c7eda5e979b25a8",
    "organization_guid": "ad9007e80f35ac6d343d43496cad2744",
    "bank_guid": "b3a9d531c26892954661735e1b7482b7",
    "event_type": "transfer.storing",
    "object_guid": "8f5ee194e5aa254feef3054bd9543939",
    "environment": "sandbox"
}
```

- `guid` \- Identifier for the event. It can also be used as an idempotency key
- `organization_guid` \- Unique identifier for the organization that owns the object. This allows the same Webhook endpoint to be registered with multiple organizations.
- `bank_guid` \- Unique identifier for the bank that owns the object associated with the event.
- `event_type` \- A tuple separated by '.' containing the type of the object (ie: trade, transfer or identity\_verification) and the type of event generated by the Cybrid platform
- `object_guid` \- Identifier for the object generating the event
- `sandbox` \- Flag to indicate if the event is a sandbox or production event. You might receive both sandbox and production mode event delivery requests to your endpoints

## Event List   [Skip link to Event List](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#event-list)

A full list of event types that we send to your Webhook endpoint(s):

trade.storing
trade.pending
trade.cancelled
trade.completed
trade.settling
trade.failed
transfer.storing
transfer.pending
transfer.reviewing
transfer.completed
transfer.failed
identity\_verification.storing
identity\_verification.pending
identity\_verification.reviewing
identity\_verification.waiting
identity\_verification.expired
identity\_verification.completed

For example, if your goal is to capture the potential error events, you can listen for `trade.failed`, `transfer.failed` and/or `identity_verification.expired`.

### Setup the Webhook Endpoint   [Skip link to Setup the Webhook Endpoint](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#setup-the-webhook-endpoint)

To start receiving Webhook events in your app, create a Webhook endpoint handler to receive event data POST requests.

Set up an HTTPS endpoint function that can accept Webhook requests with a POST method. For a sandbox setup you can use an HTTP endpoint.

> ### Production Webhook endpoints **must use HTTPS**   [Skip link to Production Webhook endpoints ,[object Object]](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#production-webhook-endpoints-must-use-https)

Set up your endpoint function so that it handles POST requests with a JSON payload consisting of a SubscriptionEvent object.

Make sure your endpoint quickly returns a successful status code (2xx) prior to any complex logic that could cause a timeout. For example, you must return a 200 response before updating a transfer in your system.

### Register the Webhook Endpoint   [Skip link to Register the Webhook Endpoint](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#register-the-webhook-endpoint)

After testing your Webhook endpoint function, register the Webhook endpoint‚Äôs accessible URL using the [Subscription API](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/reference/createsubscription) so Cybrid knows where to deliver events. See the POST call and response below:

Call POST /subscriptionsResponse POST /subscriptions

```rdmd-code lang- theme-light
curl --location --globoff '<https://cybrid.app/api/subscriptions/'>
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'

### Secure the Webhook Endpoint   [Skip link to Secure the Webhook Endpoint](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#secure-the-webhook-endpoint)

When Cybrid sends data to registered Webhook endpoints, the payload will be authenticated with a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). The key used to create the HMAC is the `signing_key` provided on subscription registration (see section above), and you verify it by running the algorithm yourself with the payload and the key to re-create the HMAC. The HMAC is created with the HMAC\_SHA256 algorithm, then encoded in hex. The HMAC is attached to the request in the `X-Cybrid-Signature` header. You can find an example on how to secure your endpoint below:

JavaScript

```rdmd-code lang- theme-light
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const PORT = 3333;
// replace SIGNING_KEY with the key received when the webhook endpoint was created
const SIGNING_KEY = "c3ac436b171923eb688a6bf364f89effd90427f4d58018e25558af3ecd506bc5"
const ALGORITHM = 'sha256'
const SIGNATURE_HEADER = 'X-Cybrid-Signature'
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json({
    verify: (req, res, buf) => {
      req.rawBody = buf;
    }
  }));
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const requestSignature = req.get(SIGNATURE_HEADER);
        const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac(ALGORITHM, SIGNING_KEY)
          .update(req.rawBody)
          .digest('hex');
        let valid_request = requestSignature === expectedSignature
        // respond with 200
        if (valid_request) {
            res.status(200).send("OK");
            console.log(`received payload ${req.body}`)
            // perform actions related to the event
        } else {
            res.status(403).send("INVALID SIGNATURE");
        }
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).send(err.toString());
    }
})
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Event Delivery Behaviour and Best Practices   [Skip link to Event Delivery Behaviour and Best Practices](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#event-delivery-behaviour-and-best-practices)

### Retry behaviour   [Skip link to Retry behaviour](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#retry-behaviour)

Cybrid attempts to deliver a given event to your Webhook endpoint for up to 3 days with an exponential back off and a maximum wait of 1 hour. Using the [SubscriptionDelivery API](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/reference/listsubscriptiondeliveries) you can view failing deliveries and when the next attempt will occur. If your endpoint subscription has been disabled or deleted when Cybrid attempts a retry, future retries of that event are prevented. If a delivery has failed, you can trigger a new retry cycle by creating a new delivery using SubscriptionDelivery API.

### Disable behaviour   [Skip link to Disable behaviour](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#disable-behaviour)

If your endpoint has not returned a successful response for multiple days Cybrid will automatically mark the endpoint as failed and it will skip future deliveries. To re-enable the endpoint, a new registration will need to be created using the Subscription API

### Event ordering   [Skip link to Event ordering](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#event-ordering)

Cybrid doesn‚Äôt guarantee delivery of events in the order in which they‚Äôre generated. For example, creating a transfer might generate the following events:

`transfer.storing` `transfer.reviewing` `transfer.completed`

Your endpoint shouldn‚Äôt expect delivery of these events in this order, and needs to handle delivery accordingly. You can also use the API to fetch the updated object and react according to the latest state of the object.

### Handle duplicate events   [Skip link to Handle duplicate events](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#handle-duplicate-events)

Webhook endpoints might occasionally receive the same event more than once. You can guard against duplicated event receipts by logging the event GUID you‚Äôve processed, and then not processing already-logged events.

### Handle events asynchronously   [Skip link to Handle events asynchronously](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#handle-events-asynchronously)

Configure your handler to process incoming events with an asynchronous queue. You might encounter scalability issues if you choose to process events synchronously. Any large spike in Webhook deliveries might overwhelm your endpoint hosts. Asynchronous queues allow you to process the concurrent events at a rate your system can support.

### Quickly return a 2xx response   [Skip link to Quickly return a 2xx response](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#quickly-return-a-2xx-response)

Your endpoint must quickly return a successful status code (2xx) prior to any complex logic that could cause a timeout. For example, you must return a 200 response before updating information in your system.

### Roll endpoint signing secrets periodically   [Skip link to Roll endpoint signing secrets periodically](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/webhooks\#roll-endpoint-signing-secrets-periodically)

To keep your Webhook handler safe, we recommend that you roll secrets periodically, or when you suspect a compromised secret. The process of rolling a Webhook signing secret consists of creating a new registration (with a new signing key), updating your Webhook handler and deleting the previous registration. This process may lead to the same event being delivered multiple times but your Webhook handler should handle duplicate events.
