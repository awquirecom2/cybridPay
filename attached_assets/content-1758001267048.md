> 1. Although **fiatAmount** and **cryptoAmount** are both not required together, you need to pass at least one of them in all _isBuyOrSell: "BUY"_ cases. Our recommendation would be to pass **fiatAmount** in such cases. If both **fiatAmount** and **cryptoAmount** are passed in case of _isBuyOrSell: "BUY"_ then **cryptoAmount** would take precedence
> 2. In case of _isBuyOrSell: "SELL"_, **cryptoAmount** is a required param. If **fiatAmount** is passed in such cases, then it will be ignored
> 3. **quoteCountryCode** is an optional param which should be passed in case you want to ensure consistency in pricing that user sees on your platform as well as ours. In case an invalid ISO 3166 Alpha-2 country code is passed then this param will not be honored.

>    Please refer to [this](https://docs.transak.com/docs/get-price-quotecountrycode) page for detailed information about the usage of `quoteCountryCode`.
