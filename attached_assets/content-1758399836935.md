When creating a new customer, there are two approaches you have to keep in mind. If you are using the Cybrid Platform for KYC, then you only need to specify the type of customer, which is individual in most cases.

Use the `POST /api/customers` endpoint to create a new customer:

#### Creating an Individual Customer   [Skip link to Creating an Individual Customer](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/how-do-i-create-a-customer\#creating-an-individual-customer)

Individual customers can be easily added to our platform. Note that all individual customers must go through Cybrid's [KYC process](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/kyc-responses#for-individuals-kyc).

```rdmd-code lang-undefined theme-light
{
  "type": "individual"
}
```

To verify the customer exists, you can navigate to the `GET /api/customers` endpoint to have all customers attached to your bank returned. The response will be similar to this:

```rdmd-code lang-undefined theme-light
{
  "total": 0,
  "page": 0,
  "per_page": 0,
  "objects": [\
    {\
      "guid": "your-customer-guid",\
      "bank_guid": "your-bank-guid",\
      "type": "individual",\
      "created_at": "2022-05-13T13:55:08.460Z",\
      "state": "unverified"\
    }]
}
```

#### Creating a Business Customer   [Skip link to Creating a Business Customer](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/how-do-i-create-a-customer\#creating-a-business-customer)

Business customers can be easily added to our platform. Note that all business customers must go through Cybrid's [KYB process](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/kyc-responses#for-businesses-kyb).

```rdmd-code lang-undefined theme-light
{
  "type": "business"
}
```

To verify the customer exists, you can navigate to the `GET /api/customers` endpoint to have all customers attached to your bank returned. The response will be similar to this:

```rdmd-code lang-undefined theme-light
{
  "total": 0,
  "page": 0,
  "per_page": 0,
  "objects": [\
    {\
      "guid": "your-customer-guid",\
      "bank_guid": "your-bank-guid",\
      "type": "business",\
      "created_at": "2022-05-13T13:55:08.460Z",\
      "state": "unverified"\
    }]
}
```

#### Customer States   [Skip link to Customer States](https://docs.cybrid.xyz/docs/how-do-i-create-a-customer\#customer-states)

Note the state of the customer will be one of the following:

- **storing** \- Indicates the platform is still storing the customer record
- **unverified** \- Indicates the customer has been stored, and is ready to be verified

With the customer created, we can now move on to finalizing the customer's identity verification.
